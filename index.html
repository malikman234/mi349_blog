      <h2>10 RA Approved Dorm Essentials for First Years Students</h2>

      <p class="center">

      <h3>1. Fan</h3>
      <p>
        Unless you live in a fairly new dorm, you might be out of luck when it
        comes to air conditioning. The first month after move in season tends to
        be the hottest time in the dorms. The rooms tend to not have the best
        ventilation, so think about investing in a box fan. They are great for
        circulating air and easy to set up. I recommend cracking the window and
        putting the fan in front of it, especially at night.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Minifridge</h3>
      <p>
        The dining halls can have funky hours and there will be times when you
        miss the dining window. Mini Fridges are great because you can eat or
        have a snack whenever you please! Pro tip, get one with a separate
        freezer because then you can microwave mac and cheese at 2am.
      </p>
      <h3>3. Shower shoes</h3>
      <p>
        If you have community restrooms it's not the end of the world! I
        actually prefer them because they get cleaned daily. I do not trust 3
        other college aged boys to keep a bathroom clean. Shower shoes are
        essential because the showers are used by 50+ people a day. The last
        thing you want are warts or a fungal infection!
      </p>
      <h3>4. Extension cords</h3>
      <p>
        Depending on how you arrange the room, the power outlets might be
        inaccessible. Extension cords easily solve this problem so you can
        charge your devices no matter where you are.
      </p>
      <h3>5. Multiple sets of sheets and towels</h3>
      <p>
        When it comes to laundry in college, letting it pile up can be super
        easy! Don't fall into this trap, do your laundry regularly. Also, you
        should have multiple sets of towels and sheets so that you have clean
        ones to use while the others are in the wash.
      </p>
      <h3>6. Snacks</h3>
      <p>
        The minifridge is one thing, but stocking it regularly is another thing.
        Having all the snacks you like are great for when you're studying, about
        to leave for class or when you're just hanging out. Also your guests
        will greatly appreciate them!
      </p>
      <h3>7. Futon</h3>
      <p>
        Speaking of guests, futons are great for additional seating or a place
        for a friend to crash. The dual functionality is great for small spaces
        like dorm rooms.
      </p>
      <h3>8. Shower robe</h3>
      <p>
        This is great if you have suite style or community restrooms. A robe is
        a super comfy and easy way to cover yourself up between the bathroom and
        your room.
      </p>
      <h3>9. Extra Storage</h3>
      <img class="storage" src="/storage.jpeg" alt="Underbed storage" />

      <p>
        Dorms are notorious for being super small, especially when you have a
        roommate. Invest in some type of storage solution like these cubes or
        under bed storage, you will thank me later.
      </p>
      <h3>10. Brita</h3>
      <p>
        Having water easily accessible to you is something that we tend to take
        for granted. Sometimes you don't want to go all the way down the hall to
        the drinking fountain. That's why britas or any other water filtering
        system are great for residents.

      <h2>What I wish I knew about choosing a major sooner!</h2>

        The idea of going off to college is something that high school seniors
        all around the country rejoice over. The allure of complete freedom and
        a fresh beginning somewhere new is completely understandable. However,
        something that can often be forgotten about in all the fun is the
        academics. Ultimately the main reason you pursue higher education is to
        learn, develop new skills and ultimately secure a job afterwards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coming into university, I had a complete plan for what I would study and
        how my future would look like. That was up until I finished my first
        year and decided that business wasn't for me. I was left feeling so lost
        and had completed credits for a degree that I no longer wanted.
      </p>

      <p id="tip1">
        <b>Pro tip #1</b>: Don’t take a semester worth of major specific courses
        unless you are 100% set on that path. Take a few exploratory classes and
        the rest should be prerequisites for your first year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually I found advertising and I thought that was the new path
        forward. I started fresh taking all the classes required and after the
        fall semester, I wasn’t convinced but I continued with the classes for
        spring semester anyways.
      </p>
      <p id="tip2">
        <b>Pro tip # 2</b>: Trust your gut! If you don’t enjoy what you are
        doing, make that change. It’s better to be at the bottom of a ladder you
        want to be on, rather than at the top of one you don’t want to be on.
      </p>
      <p>
        I spent that summer doing so much research and soul searching into what
        I actually wanted to pursue. By a stroke of pure luck, I found UI/UX
        design and I instantly knew this was for me. It was the intersection of
        all the things I loved.
      </p>
      <p id="tip3">
        <b>Pro tip # 3</b>: Set up informal interviews with alumni either
        virtually or in person to ask all the questions you want to know about
        the real working world. They were in your shoes once and a lot of people
        want to give back.
      </p>
      <p>
        Choosing your major can be very stressful, but you just need to be
        patient with yourself. It is completely normal to change your major once
        or even several times. Don’t be afraid to explore, that is what college
        is for!
